=head1 NAME

OpenSSL::Test - a private extension of Test::More

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use OpenSSL::Test;

  setup("my_test_name");

  ok(run(app(["openssl", "version"])), "check for openssl presence");

  indir "subdir" => sub {
    ok(run(test(["sometest", "arg1"], stdout => "foo.txt")),
       "run sometest with output to foo.txt");
  };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a private extension of L<Test::More> for testing OpenSSL.
In addition to the Test::More functions, it also provides functions that
easily find the diverse programs within a OpenSSL build tree, as well as
some other useful functions.

This module I<depends> on the environment variable C<$TOP>.  Without it,
it refuses to work.  See L</ENVIRONMENT> below.

=head2 Main functions

The following functions are exported by default when using C<OpenSSL::Test>.

=cut

=over 4

=item B<setup "NAME">

C<setup> is used for initial setup, and it is mandatory that it's used.
If it's not used in a OpenSSL test recipe, the rest of the recipe will
most likely refuse to run.

C<setup> checks for environment variables (see L</ENVIRONMENT> below),
check that C<$TOP/Configure> exists, C<chdir> into the results directory
(defined by the C<$RESULT_D> environment variable if defined, otherwise
C<$TEST_D> if defined, otherwise C<$TOP/test>).

=back

=cut

sub setup {
    $test_name = shift;

    BAIL_OUT("setup() must receive a name") unless $test_name;
    BAIL_OUT("setup() needs \$TOP to be defined") unless $ENV{TOP};

    __env();

    BAIL_OUT("setup() expects the file Configure in the \$TOP directory")
	unless -f top_file("Configure");

    __cwd($directories{RESULTS});

    # Loop in case we're on a platform with more than one file generation
    1 while unlink(__test_log());
}

=over 4

=item B<indir "SUBDIR" =E<gt> sub BLOCK, OPTS>

C<indir> is used to run a part of the recipe in a different directory than
the one C<setup> moved into, usually a subdirectory, given by SUBDIR.
The part of the recipe that's run there is given by the codeblock BLOCK.

C<indir> takes some additional options OPTS that affect the subdirectory:

=over 4

=item B<create =E<gt> 0|1>

When set to 1 (or any value that perl preceives as true), the subdirectory
will be created if it doesn't already exist.  This happens before BLOCK
is executed.

=item B<cleanup =E<gt> 0|1>

When set to 1 (or any value that perl preceives as true), the subdirectory
will be cleaned out and removed.  This happens both before and after BLOCK
is executed.

=back

An example:

  indir "foo" => sub {
      ok(run(app(["openssl", "version"]), stdout => "foo.txt"));
      if (ok(open(RESULT, "foo.txt"), "reading foo.txt")) {
          my $line = <RESULT>;
          close RESULT;
          is($line, qr/^OpenSSL 1\./,
             "check that we're using OpenSSL 1.x.x");
      }
  }, create => 1, cleanup => 1;

=back

=cut

sub indir {
    my $subdir = shift;
    my $codeblock = shift;
    my %opts = @_;

    my $reverse = __cwd($subdir,%opts);
    BAIL_OUT("FAILURE: indir, \"$subdir\" wasn't possible to move into")
	unless $reverse;

    $codeblock->();

    __cwd($reverse);

    if ($opts{cleanup}) {
	remove_tree($subdir, { safe => 0 });
    }
}

=over 4

=item B<app ARRAYREF, OPTS>

=item B<test ARRAYREF, OPTS>

Both of these functions take a reference to a list that is a command and
its arguments, and some additional options (described further on).

C<app> expects to find the given command (the first item in the given list
reference) as an executable in C<$BIN_D> (if defined, otherwise C<$TOP/apps>).

C<test> expects to find the given command (the first item in the given list
reference) as an executable in C<$TEST_D> (if defined, otherwise C<$TOP/test>).

Both return a CODEREF to be used by C<run>, C<pipe> or C<cmdstr>.

The options that both C<app> and C<test> can take are in the form of hash
values:

=over 4

=item B<stdin =E<gt> PATH>

=item B<stdout =E<gt> PATH>

=item B<stderr =E<gt> PATH>

In all three cases, the corresponding standard input, output or error is
redirected from (for stdin) or to (for the others) a file given by the
string PATH, I<or>, if the value is C<undef>, C</dev/null> or similar.

sub app {
    my $cmd = shift;
    my %opts = @_;

sub test {
    my $cmd = shift;
    my %opts = @_;
    return sub { my $num = shift;
		 return __build_cmd($num, \&__test_file, $cmd, %opts); }
}

=over 4

=item B<run CODEREF, OPTS>

This CODEREF is expected to be the value return by C<app> or C<test>,
anything else will most likely cause an error unless you know what you're
doing.

C<run> executes the command returned by CODEREF and return either the
resulting output (if the option C<capture> is set true) or a boolean indicating
if the command succeeded or not.

The options that C<run> can take are in the form of hash values:

=over 4

=item B<capture =E<gt> 0|1>

If true, the command will be executed with a perl backtick, and C<run> will
return the resulting output as an array of lines.  If false or not given,
the command will be executed with C<system()>, and C<run> will return 1 if
the command was successful or 0 if it wasn't.

=back

For further discussion on what is considered a successful command or not, see
the function C<with> further down.

=item B<top_dir LIST>

LIST is a list of directories that make up a path from the top of the OpenSSL
source directory (as indicated by the environment variable C<$TOP>).
C<top_dir> returns the resulting directory as a string, adapted to the local
operating system.

=item B<top_file LIST, FILENAME>

LIST is a list of directories that make up a path from the top of the OpenSSL
source directory (as indicated by the environment variable C<$TOP>) and
FILENAME is the name of a file located in that directory path.
C<top_file> returns the resulting file path as a string, adapted to the local
operating system.

=item B<pipe LIST>

LIST is a list of CODEREFs returned by C<app> or C<test>, from which C<pipe>
creates a new command composed of all the given commands put together in a
pipe.  C<pipe> returns a new CODEREF in the same manner as C<app> or C<test>,
to be passed to C<run> for execution.

=item B<with HASHREF, CODEREF>

C<with> will temporarly install hooks given by the HASHREF and then execute
the given CODEREF.  Hooks are usually expected to have a coderef as value.

The currently available hoosk are:

=over 4

=item B<exit_checker =E<gt> CODEREF>

This hook is executed after C<run> has performed its given command.  The
CODEREF receives the exit code as only argument and is expected to return
1 (if the exit code indicated success) or 0 (if the exit code indicated
failure).

LIST is a list of strings that are going to be used as arguments for a

on the content of each string.

This can also be used to put quotes around the executable of a command.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

OpenSSL::Test depends on some environment variables.

=over 4

=item B<TOP>

This environment variable is mandatory.  C<setup> will check that it's
defined and that it's a directory that contains the file C<Configure>.
If this isn't so, C<setup> will C<BAIL_OUT>.

=item B<BIN_D>

If defined, its value should be the directory where the openssl application
is located.  Defaults to C<$TOP/apps> (adapted to the operating system).

=item B<TEST_D>

If defined, its value should be the directory where the test applications
are located.  Defaults to C<$TOP/test> (adapted to the operating system).

=item B<RESULT_D>

If defined, its value should be the directory where the log files are
located.  Defaults to C<$TEST_D>.

=item B<STOPTEST>

If defined, it puts testing in a different mode, where a recipe with
failures will result in a C<BAIL_OUT> at the end of its run.
