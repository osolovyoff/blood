=head1 NAME

OpenSSL::Test::Simple - a few very simple test functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use OpenSSL::Test::Simple;

  simple_test("my_test_name", "des", "destest");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sometimes, the functions in L<OpenSSL::Test> are quite tedious for some
repetitive tasks.  This module provides functions to make life easier.
You could call them hacks if you wish.

=item B<simple_test NAME, PROGRAM, ALGORITHM>

Runs a test named NAME, running the program PROGRAM with no arguments,
to test the algorithm ALGORITHM.

A complete recipe looks like this:

  use OpenSSL::Test::Simple;

  simple_test("test_bf", "bftest", "bf");

# args:
#  name			(used with setup())
#  algorithm		(used to check if it's at all supported)
#  name of binary	(the program that does the actual test)
sub simple_test {
    my ($name, $prgr, $algo, @rest) = @_;

    setup($name);

    plan tests => 1;
  SKIP: {
      skip "$algo is not supported by this OpenSSL build, skipping this test...", 1
	  if $algo && run(app(["openssl", "no-$algo"]));

      ok(run(test([$prgr])), "running $prgr");
    }
